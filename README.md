# LearningCDK

This repo presents a sequence of tutorials that can be followed to learn the CDK.

The tutorials are based on my own need to learn by building working examples that make small incremental
feature improvements. Some of the impressive examples that showcase the possibilities of the CDK, but seem like
a difficult entry point for learning.

Detailed documetation can be found at https://learningcdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
